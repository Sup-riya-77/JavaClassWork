Interface in Java:
An interface in Java is a blueprint of a class. It has static constants and abstract methods.
The interface in Java is a mechanism to achieve abstraction. There can be only abstract methods in the Java interface,
 not method body. It is used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java.
 A class that implements an interface must implement all the methods declared in the interface.
